Overall this is a space mission project that aims to solve simple yet non-trivial problems under a set of assumptions. Refer to the examples folder to see some of the new functions in action. 

Workflow 1
This workflow demonstrates delta V calculations, both the amount available and the amount needed to acheive a desired orbit to ensure there is enough propellent. It then demonstrates what that orbit would look like in an ideal situation (no atmospheric or lunar effects) but introduces some anomalies during the orbit. It then uses one of the available anomaly detection techniques to find all the anomalous points and circles them on a figure with the trajectory.

Workflow 2
This workflow demonstrates the simulation of a satellite's orbit over a specified time frame, accounting for atmospheric drag but still neglecting lunar gravity and visualizes the orbit with a time-based color gradient. It also demos how to evaluate power generation versus consumption based on desired confidence percentage and montecarlo simulations

Workflow 3
This workflow demonstrates the simulation of a satellite's orbit over an extended period, considering lunar gravity, and visualizes both the trajectory and the evolution of orbital elements over time.

Workflow 4
This workflow demonstrates the simulation of a satellite's orbit with anomaly detection, attitude control, visibility assessment, and communication link evaluation, providing a comprehensive overview of satellite operations in a simulated environment.
